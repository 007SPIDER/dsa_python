1. list is a linear collection of data items which is also know as list items .
2. collection of items required for a purpose .( pooja list for pooja).
3. numbering list items can help us to find the elements (any shopkeeper can say items 13 is not with us currently) .
4. numbering can also help to count the objects and numbering menas total no of elements present in the listbook .
5. size of the list is not fixed ,we donot know whether any new element can be added or not so size is not restricted .
6. we can remove the unwanted elements too & if we have to correct number so all elements right to that element should be adjusted .
7. from some list chances are there we cannot remove the elements but we can add the elements .
8. int , str are predefined class in python .
9. in collection data structure we can store user-defined class .( which can handle multiple properties related to a particular object) .
10. what is genric type programming?
11. Node,Start,None are 3 imporant concepts in SLL.
12. Node class is created with 2 instance variables( item & next)
13. SLL :-> linear data structure and each node is single link to next node
14. it can grow & srink
15.  sll_object(start)--> node_object(item/next)--> next again point to the --> node_object--> last next referrs to the None
16.  operations :-> insertion(start,end,after_a_node(item)),delete(first,last,particular node). for inserting element after a node we have to first search the element and then we have to add after/before it
17.  point/link means having refrance of that object is stored in a variable and if no ref name tag is pointing to that object then it is eligible for garbage collection
18.  is_empty()
19.  traverse() :-> going each element one by one
20.  iterable(__iter__ and __next__)
21.  del is used to delete the refrance of the object not object and when ref count is 0 , the object becomes eligibale for the garbage collection.
