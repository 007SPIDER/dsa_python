Data Structure :->
***
1. Arranging/structuring data in such a way , we can complete particular task very easily .
2. ledger(to get profit-loss),map(with pictures) are also a data structuring method .
3. bank statement , passbook , directory->file is also a data structuring mehtod.
4. data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in computer so that it can be used effiecently to complete a task.
5. to handle bulk literals/values we also use ds.DS is stored in RAM.
6. ds divided into 2 types ( linear & non-linear).
7. linear :-> array,dynamic array,linked list , struct,queue,deque etc.
8. non-linear :-> bst,avl,b-tree,graph.
9. an algo is the logic to solve a particular problem.so it is linguistic representation of steps to solve a given problem.
10. we store 2 things in computer (program & data)
11. function f:x->y is a mapping from set_x to set_y where for every x in set_x there exists exactly one y from set_y i.e f(x)-> returns y
12. we can reduce the set_x and set_y value to make it as function
13. phone number cannot be function of an employee , since one employee can have more than one phone number . But to make it as funtion we can combine the all
    phone numbers as an array element to cover it and make it as single element.
